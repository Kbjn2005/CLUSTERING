Algorithm Type
Unsupervised Learning → Clustering

📊 Data Loaded
Numerical dataset loaded into feature matrix x
Data scaled before clustering

⚙️ Mechanism Used
K-Means works by:
Selecting K centroids
Assigning points to nearest centroid
Updating centroids iteratively
Minimizing WCSS (Within Cluster Sum of Squares)

🔧 Parameter Selection
Elbow Method used to select optimal K

📈 Evaluation
Elbow graph
Cluster compactness

📤 Output
