Unsupervised Learning → Clustering

📊 Data Loaded
Input dataset x is loaded as a numerical feature matrix
Data represents multi-dimensional points used for density analysis
No target labels are required

⚙️ Mechanism Used
DBSCAN groups data points based on density:
Points within a distance eps form neighborhoods
If a neighborhood has at least min_samples, it becomes a cluster
Sparse points are marked as noise (-1)

🔧 Parameters Tuned
eps: 3 → 10
min_samples: eps + 1, eps + 2, …
Best values chosen by minimum number of noise points

📈 Evaluation
Number of -1 (outliers)
eps vs noise graphs

📤 Output
Cluster labels
Noise points
